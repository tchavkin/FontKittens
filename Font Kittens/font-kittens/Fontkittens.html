                <p>Allison Kitty wanted to go first. Always the lovable center 
                of attention, she keeps up with all the modern trends. Hastily signing autographs as she runs 
                backstage, Allison Kitty gives her fans a feeling of energy and artistic grace as she goes. 
                Starting off as a vocalist in garage bands, her fan base is growing. Her fantasy-script roots 
                meet the complexity of a rushed and modern world, making for a distinctive sound. For those that 
                love her style, Allison Kitten never fails to bring the house down!

                <p>Windsong Kitty has the handwriting of a dreamy, aspiring author, mostly because he is one. 
                    Seen here taken-aback by the raw glory of a fall day, Windsong Kitty has a huge heart. 
                    While classically trained and educated, he has, by now, seen enough of the world to know 
                    his way around. Successfully conveying deep topics to the reading public can be hard! 
                    Windsong Kitty has the warmth of traditional pen-calligraphy, and he is determined 
                    to remain an artistic individual.
